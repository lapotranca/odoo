Inventory Turnover Analysis Report
----------------------------------
	Cash flow is very important for all the businesses, especially those who deal with inventories. 
	Turning inventory into cash is critical for a company to pay its obligations when they are due.
	Inventory turnover is a ratio showing how many times a company has sold and replaced inventory during a given period. 
	It helps to classify inventory movements whether products have Fast movement, Slow movements or No movements.
	Commonly, inventory turnover ratio is widely used almost everywhere whether making business decisions, or while borrowing a loan, or while valuing a firm or when comparing goods, etc.

	Importance of Turnover Analysis
	--------------------------------
	Turning inventory into cash
	Cash flow will be blocked if the items in inventory do not get sold because the company has a significant amount of money tied up in its inventory. That’s why it’s important to know when company inventory turns into cash.
	Identify demand uncertainty
	It might be possible that product demand decreased, perhaps become outmoded or even retrogress. If this happens the company will lose money. It will also slow down warehouse efficiency gradually if there are more inventories which are having very slow movements. That’s why it’s necessary to know demand uncertainty. 
	Identify risk of holding inventory
	Based on the inventory turnover ratio users can identify whether the money is invested in the right products or not. To monitor and manage risk turnover ratio analysis is mandatory.
	Prevent overstocking
	Overstocking is a nightmare for any business which blocks companies cash flow,
	having too much of the wrong inventory items can result in financial problems. That’s why preventing overstock is necessary for businesses.

	Advantage of Turnover analysis
	-------------------------------
	Higher inventory turnover ratio means companies selling products very frequently and replaced by fresh products stock. There are following benefits of higher inventory turnover ratio.

	Price stability
		Turning over inventory quickly helps you maintain price stability.
	Fresh products
		By selling efficiently, you can keep fresh new products coming in and regularly rotate items in different display areas to get the attention of regular customers.
	Buying power
		If you consistently sell products in high volumes, you can order more on each purchase and get better rates. This improves your inventory costs.
	Less waste
		High turnover also helps you protect against waste from perishable or expired items.
	
Inventory FSN Analysis Report
-----------------------------
	FSN stands for fast-moving, slow-moving and non-moving items.  It looks at quantity, consumption rate and how often the item is issued and used.
	It helps in arrangement of stocks in stores and their distribution and handling methods. The main aim of this analysis is to control obsolescence of the inventories. If there is a rapid change in technology then this classification will have to be updated more often

	FSN analysis is stock turnover ratio based analysis. Stock turnover ratio is defined as the ratio of annual consumption of a material divided by its average inventory i.e.
	The items can be classified into three categories viz
	Fast moving (F) those items whose stock turnover ratio is greater than 3.
	Slow moving (S) those items whose stock turnover ratio is between 1 and 3.
	Non moving (N) those items whose stock turnover ratio is below 1.

	Advantage of FSN analysis
	---------------------------
	FSN Classification helps to identify dead stock, fast moving inventories.
	FSN analysis can be beneficial for showing which items are active in your inventory. 
	FSN analysis helps you make smarter buying decisions from suppliers and keep inventory relevant to demand
	The non-moving items are surplus to requirements and could be taking up precious real estate in the warehouse.

Inventory XYZ Analysis Report
------------------------------
	XYZ Analysis is always done for the current Stock in Inventory and aims at classifying the items into three classes on the basis of their Inventory values. 
	The current value of the items/variants in the Inventory alone is taken into consideration for the Analysis and it is not possible to do this analysis for any other dates. 

	First 70% of the total Inventory value corresponds to X Class 
	Next 20% are of Y Class 
	Last 10% of the value corresponds to the Z Class.


	Advantage of XYZ analysis
	--------------------------
	XYZ classification helps to identify inventories investment status
	XYZ classification helps to decide action plan for existing inventories whether any inventories require strategically sales planning or not 
	XYZ classification helps to  evaluate how each inventory part should be monitored and controlled.
	Some inventories are critically important and require close monitoring and tight control.
	Some inventories are of lower criticality requiring standard controls and periodic reviews of usage. 
	Some require the least controls, are sometimes issued as “free stock” or forward holding.

Inventory FSN-XYZ Combine Analysis Report / FSN-XYZ Analysis report
-------------------------------------------------------------------
	In any industry, not all items are required with the same frequency. Some materials are quite regularly required, yet some others are required very occasionally and some materials may have become obsolete and might not have been demanded for years together.

	XYZ analysis when combined with FSN analysis helps to formulate more specific strategies. 
	Last two categories are reviewed further deciding disposal actions to deplete their stock and thereby release the company's productive capital.

	A closing stock theory applied to a combination of XYZ with FSN indicates: If a non-moving (N) item is found in X category i.e. NX category, the decision is to dispose of the N items by selling them off. By salvaging NX items space as well as money can be saved

	Advantage of FSN-XYZ Combine Analysis
	--------------------------------------
	XYZ analysis when combined with FSN analysis helps to formulate more specific strategies. 
	FSN-XYZ combined analysis helps to identify dead stock or dead investment
	FSN-XYZ combined analysis clarifies service levels for items with volatile demand.
	It helps to reduces stock obsolescence
	It helps to Improve accuracy of forecasting.
	Reduces stock-outs, which:
	Improves production stability and efficiency.
	Improves customer satisfaction.

	It’s mandatory to identify the stock level and stock age to make purchase decisions better, making sales strategies. An inventory aging report is a list of the items on hand grouped by the length of time in inventory.

	Advantage of Inventory Ageing Analysis
	---------------------------------------
	Allows you to focus your attention on the slowest moving items
	Improves decision making on the timing and quantity of inventory purchases or production
